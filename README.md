Getting Started
This project involves both React and NestJS applications.

Frontend (React)
The frontend was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Backend (NestJS)
NestJS is used to handle the server-side logic, leveraging the modern JavaScript environment of Node.js and TypeScript for enhanced performance and scalability.

Available Scripts
Frontend Scripts (React)
In the React project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

Backend Scripts (NestJS)
In the NestJS project directory, you can run:

npm run start
Runs the NestJS application.
Open http://localhost:3000 to access the backend API.

npm run start:dev
